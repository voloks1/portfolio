# Personal Portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences as a web developer. The goal is to create a modern, responsive, and user-friendly platform that highlights my work and provides potential employers or clients with a comprehensive view of my capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, chosen for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering.
- **TypeScript**: Used for type safety and enhanced development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for fast and responsive design implementation.
- **Shadcn**: Leveraged for modern, accessible, and customizable UI components.

## Features

- **Not So Responsive Design**: I still working to improve the responsivity to the project.
- **Minimalist UI**: Incorporates minimalist elements to make a clean and understandable UI.
- **Project Showcase**: A dedicated section to display and detail various projects I've worked on, including links to live demos and GitHub repositories.
- **Contact Form**: A simple and functional contact form that allows visitors to reach out directly from the website.
